# Rails Kittens-API

A Rails API application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project demonstrates building a data-producing API where controllers render JSON data instead of HTML views.

## About This Project

This is a learning project from [The Odin Project's Rails course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails), specifically the [APIs lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-apis). The goal is to understand how to:

- Build a Rails application configured as an API
- Structure controllers to return JSON responses
- Handle API requests and responses
- Work with serialization

## Learning Resources
